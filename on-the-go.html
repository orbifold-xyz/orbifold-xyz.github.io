            <h1>On The Go</h1>
Sun 14 August 2022

        </div>
	
        <div><p>Now that travel is more realistic,
I have started to optimize how well I can work on the go.
I want to be able to carry as few things as possible,
and have the best set-up possible.</p>
<div class="section" id="charging">
<h2>Charging</h2>
<img alt="Power Bank charging" src="bank.jpg" style="width: 400px;" />
<p>The
&quot;center&quot;
of the mobile set-up is my
<a class="reference external" href="https://www.anker.com/products/a1651">Anker Power Bank</a>.
It serves two purposes:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>It is my wall-plug charger.</li>
<li>It is my &quot;mobile power&quot;:
I can carry around 10k mAH
of energy.</li>
</ul>
<p>The charger has two
USB-C
slots
and one
USB-A
slot.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="compute">
<h2>Compute</h2>
<img alt="M1 MacBook Air with stickers" src="m1-air.jpg" style="width: 400px;" />
<p>For
&quot;compute&quot;,
I have three
devices:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>M1 MacBook Air</li>
<li>Galaxy Samsung S9+
(I know it's a bit old)</li>
<li>FitBit Charge 4</li>
</ul>
<p>The S9 is old enough that
there is no case with a
MagSafe
compatible back.
Instead,
I got a
MagSafe
sticker
that goes on the back of the case.</p>
<p>This allowed me to get a
MagSafe Pop-Socket base.
Sticking a
Pop-Socket
on top of it
lets me hold the phone securely,
and avoids it falling on my face at night.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ear-buds">
<h2>Ear buds</h2>
<p>For earbuds,
I have the
<a class="reference external" href="https://www.tozostore.com/buygoods/63">TOZO T10</a>.
They come in multiple colors!</p>
<p>The colors are not just an
aesthetic choice.
They also serve a purpose:
I have a black one and a khaki one.</p>
<p>The black one is paired to my phone.
The khaki one is paired to my laptop.</p>
<p>I can charge the
TOZO
cases with either
the
USB-C
cable
or the
PowerWave
charger,
whichever is free.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="charging-1">
<h2>Charging</h2>
<img alt="Phone charging with a wireless MagSafe charger" src="charging.jpg" style="width: 400px;" />
<p>In order to charge the
M1
I have a
USB-C &quot;outtie&quot;/USB-C &quot;outtie&quot;
3 foot wire.
It's a bit short,
but this also means it takes less space.
The
FitBit Charge
comes with its own
USB-A
custom cable.</p>
<p>For wireless charging,
I have the
<a class="reference external" href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B095NQTNLZ/">Anker PowerWave</a>.
It's
MagSafe
compatible,
and can connect to any
USB-C-compatible
outlet.</p>
<p>The phone is only charged by
the wireless charging.
The
USB-C
input is wonky,
and can be incompatible with humid climates.</p>
<p>I connected a
Pop Socket
to the back of the
PowerWave charger.
This means that while the phone is charging,
I can still hold it securely.</p>
<p>Together,
they give me a
&quot;wireless charging&quot;
battery.
The
PowerWave connects to the phone,
and the
Power Bank
has plenty of energy to last for a while
while not connecting to anything.</p>
<p>I cannot charge
<em>all</em>
devices at once.
But I can charge
all
devices,
and
(almost)
any three at once.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="hub">
<h2>Hub</h2>
<img alt="USB-C hub" src="hub.jpg" style="width: 400px;" />
<p>The last device I have is an older version of the
<a class="reference external" href="https://www.anker.com/products/a8338?variant=37438363205782">Anker 5-in-1 hub</a>.
This allows connecting
USB Drives
and
HDMI connectors.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="case">
<h2>Case</h2>
<img alt="Power Bank charging" src="bag.jpg" style="width: 400px;" />
<p>All of these things are carried in a
<a class="reference external" href="https://us.targus.com/products/vertical-12-inch-laptop-slipcase-sleeve-with-hideaway-handles-tss912">Targus TSS912</a>
case.
The laptop goes inside the sleeve,
while the other things all go in the
side pocket.</p>
<p>The
side pocket
is small,
but can fit all of the things above.
Because of its size,
it does get crowded.
In order to find things easily,
I keep all of these things
in separate
sub-pockets.</p>
<p>I keep the
Power Bank,
the
MagSafe charger,
and the
USB-C/USB-C
cable
in the little pouch that comes with the
Power Bank.</p>
<p>The
hub
and
FitBit
charging cable
go into a ziplock bag.
Those things see less use.</p>
<p>The earbud cases go into the pocket as-is.
They are easy enough to dig out by rooting around.</p>
<p>I wanted a
messenger-style
case
so that I can carry it
<em>while</em>
I have a
backpack
on.
Whether I am carrying my work laptop
(in the work backpack)
or a travel backpack,
this is a distinct advantage.</p>
<p>The case is small enough to be slipped inside another
backpack.
If I am carrying a backpack,
and there's enough room,
I can consolidate.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="conclusion">
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>I chose this set up for options.</p>
<p>For example,
if my phone is low on battery,
I can connect the
PowerWave
to the bank,
leave the bank in the side-bag's pocket,
and
and keep using the phone while it is charging,
holding it with the
PowerWave's
pop-sockets.</p>
<p>If I am listening to a podcast while walking around,
and notice that the ear bud's case is low on battery,
I can connect the case to the bank
while they are both in the
side-bag's
pocket.</p>
<p>When sitting down at a coffee shop
or an office,
I can connect the bank to the wall socket
and charge any of my devices while sitting there.
As a perk
the bank is charging
while I'm sitting down.</p>
