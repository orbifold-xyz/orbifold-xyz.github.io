            <h1>Virtual Buffet Line</h1>
Thu 18 February 2021

        <div><p>Many people have written about the
<a class="reference external" href="ttps://twitter.com/chrisjrn/status/996765333108146177">logistical challenges</a>
of food in a conference.
You trade off not just,
as Chris points out,
expensive food versus terrible food,
but also the challenges of serving the food
to everyone at once.</p>
<p>One natural method of crowd control is the buffet line.
People shuffling slowly through the line,
picking food items,
allows for a natural choke-point that avoids
overwhelming table and staff availability.
It is unpleasant to have to walk slowly,
at the pace of the slowest decision maker,
while hungry.</p>
<p>As humans do,
one tries to make the best of a bad situation.
All of the people in the conference share some common interests,
and many of them have interesting tales besides.
A common way of entertaining yourself in the line
is to strike up a conversation with the random person
before or ahead of you.
Indeed, this has led me to hear some fascinating things:
tales of incidents,
new libraries,
or just interesting perspectives.</p>
<p>With a global pandemic looming,
responsible folks have either cancelled conferences or
led virtual conferences.
Virtual conferences,
especially while a global pandemic ravages the world,
are nowhere as good as the real thing.</p>
<p>One of my favorite things in conferences is the so-called
hallway track,
where we stand and chat about common interests.
Friendly and inclusive people stand in the
&quot;pac-man&quot;
shape,
so that people can join the conversation.
I have learned a lot from these random conversations.</p>
<p>As humans do,
one tries to make the best of a bad situation.
While we are stuck at home,
at least lunch time is easy.
When you want to eat,
order a delivery or step into the kitchen
and food,
chosen by you,
is available.
No shuffling.
No waiting.</p>
<p>So far,
no conference has tried to have a virtual buffet line,
where people are forced to virtually wait in a line
before eating.
True,
the random conversations are gone,
but they have always been a coping mechanism,
not the intent.
If the pandemic continues,
however,
I am not sure this will remain true.</p>
<p>Conferences have
<em>already</em>
tried to
&quot;recreate&quot;
many of the constraints foisted upon physical conferences
by the uncaring laws of physics
in order to make them feel more
&quot;real&quot;.
This rarely helps the
&quot;realism&quot;
but often creates new,
unexpected problem.</p>
<p>One conference platform allows for
&quot;virtual coffee tables&quot;
where 2-10 people
(depending on the table)
can sit.
Once the table is &quot;full&quot;,
nobody else can join the conversation.
Table-mates can speak via text, video, or audio.</p>
<p>The reason real hallway tables are set for 2-10 people
is because of physical constraints
and avaialbility of furniture.
There was no careful design of which combination of 2-10-sized tables
makes for an
&quot;optimal&quot;
experience.</p>
<p>Further,
this is not even a good recreation.
With real tables,
space is somewhat negotiable.
An extra person can fit in
if the seated people will let them.
People can see the conversation.
People can trade-off a subtle
&quot;how eaves-droppy&quot;
they want to be.
You can stand next to the table for a long time,
but possibly perceived as weird.
You can pass by quickly,
catch a whiff of the conversation.
You can hear from afar,
but only distorted highlights</p>
<p>These things mean,
for example,
someone seated at a table trying to harass a table-mate
chances being seen and caught by random people.
While we hope that this is not the only thing preventing
people from harassing,
this is a useful social enforcement tool.
However,
the &quot;virtual tables&quot;
are more like
&quot;virtual isolation rooms&quot;.
Stuck inside one with an unpleasant person
means they can say and do what they will
with no fear of witnesses.</p>
<p>How does Code of Conduct enforcement happens?
How do vulnerable demographics feel about that?</p>
<p>Attempting to recreate a physical experience in a virtual world
is doomed to failure,
unless you have sophisticated science-fictional-level
virtual reality and physics simulation.
However,
as a culture,
we have adapted to video chats,
video webinars,
text chats and more.
We figured out social conventions and norms,
and how to enforce them.</p>
<p>When designing a virtual conference,
concentrating on
&quot;physical fidelity&quot;
is a fool's errand.
Instead,
figure out what kind of pleasant virtual experiences you want to supply,
how to enforce those norms you want to enforce,
and how to communicate expected standards to the attendees.</p>
<p>Just like physical conferences can be different,
virtual conferences can be different.
Pre-recorded or live talks,
video distribution platforms,
chatting platforms,
and more,
need to be chosen carefully.
Optimize for a good conference,
not a conference that feels
like an in-person conference.</p>
