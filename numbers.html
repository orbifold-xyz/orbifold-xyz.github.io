            <h1>Numbers in Python</h1>

        <div><p>Numbers in Python come in all shapes and forms.
The reason different kind of representations of numbers exist is because
they all have different trade-offs.
These trade-offs are often surprising!</p>
<div class="section" id="integers">
<h2>Integers</h2>
<p>The most surprising things about integers is how easily they stop being
integers.
Dividing two integers, for example,
<code>4/3</code>,
gives a float,
and <code>(4/3)*3</code> is the
<em>float</em>
<code>4.0</code>.
Even if a program has no floating point numbers coming in,
all that is needed for floating point numbers to exist
somewhere is a division operation.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="floats">
<h2>Floats</h2>
<p>Floats do not behave like numbers.
Numbers obey certain mathematical properties:
subtraction is the inverse to addition,
addition is associative,
and more.</p>
<p>For example</p>
<pre class="code literal-block">
&gt;&gt;&gt; 1 + 2 - 2 - 1
0
&gt;&gt;&gt; 0.1 + 0.2 - 0.2 - 0.1
2.7755575615628914e-17
</pre>
<p>adding two numbers,
and then subtracting them one at a time,
does not result in the same value.</p>
<p>They do not obey the associative law of addition,
<code>a + (b + c) = (a + b) + c</code>:</p>
<pre class="code literal-block">
&gt;&gt;&gt; a = 2**-53
&gt;&gt;&gt; (a + a) + 1 == a + (a + 1)
False
</pre>
<p>These show just two of the corner cases that floating point numbers
exhibit,
which can be surprising.
A full treatise on the ways that floating point behavior can be surprising
is too big to fit in the margin of this blog post.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="fractions">
<h2>Fractions</h2>
<p>Many algorithms that look straightforward
&quot;explode&quot;
with exact fractions.
Explosion usually starts as time explosion:
the algorithm becomes &quot;quadratic&quot;:
the time it takes is proportional not to the input length,
but to the scare of the input's length.
In other words, doubling the input size
<em>quadruples</em>
the time it takes.</p>
<p>If enough time is spent,
memory explosion is also possible:
the space requirements increase,
until all memory fills up.</p>
<p>One weird protection against memory explosion
is that usually it will take too long to get it,
and the program will be killed for
&quot;hanging&quot;.</p>
<p>One such &quot;algorithm&quot; is addition.</p>
<pre class="code literal-block">
&gt;&gt;&gt; print(set(type(p) for p in primes))
&gt;&gt;&gt; one = fractions.Fraction(1)
&gt;&gt;&gt; before = datetime.now()
&gt;&gt;&gt; res = sum(one/p for p in primes[:10000])
&gt;&gt;&gt; after = datetime.now()
&gt;&gt;&gt; print(&quot;It took&quot;, after-before)
&gt;&gt;&gt; print(&quot;Size of output&quot;, len(str(res)))
&gt;&gt;&gt; print(&quot;Approximate value&quot;, float(res))
{&lt;class 'int'&gt;}
It took 0:01:16.033260
Size of output 90676
Approximate value 2.7092582487972945
</pre>
<p>This is just adding the inverses to some primes
(I removed the first few from the list,
and then chopped the list to be the next 10,000).
On a nice laptop designed as a gaming rig,
adding 10,000 numbers took
over a minute,
and resulted in an output that was over 90K!</p>
<p>In comparison,
running the same algorithm with floats is much more efficient:</p>
<pre class="code literal-block">
&gt;&gt;&gt; print(set(type(p) for p in primes))
&gt;&gt;&gt; before = datetime.now()
&gt;&gt;&gt; res = sum(1/p for p in primes[:10000])
&gt;&gt;&gt; after = datetime.now()
&gt;&gt;&gt; print(&quot;It took&quot;, after-before)
&gt;&gt;&gt; print(&quot;Size of output&quot;, len(str(res)))
&gt;&gt;&gt; print(&quot;Approximate value&quot;, float(res))
{&lt;class 'int'&gt;}
It took 0:00:00.000480
Size of output 17
Approximate value 2.709258248797317
</pre>
<p>The time it took is less than a millisecond,
and some of that is possibly measurement error from
<cite>datetime</cite>.
This is around 10,000 times faster.
The output can be saved in 17 bytes:
a mere 1000 reduction in space.
However, the result is inaccurate:</p>
<pre class="code literal-block">
Approximate value 2.7092582487972945
Approximate value 2.709258248797317
                    1234567891234
</pre>
<p>The results are off by less than <code>1e-14</code>.
This would be like getting the distance to the moon wrong
by one millimeter.
In cases that do not involve sending a rocket to the moon with
less than a millimeter
(one grain of sand)
tolerance,
floats give a result that is precise enough
and several orders of magnitude more efficient.</p>
<p>A lot of the responses to this were along the lines of
&quot;fractions are slow because they are implemented in Python&quot;.
Python can be responsible for a 10x slowdown,
but not 10,000x.
There is a third-party module,
<code>quicktions</code>,
which implements fractions using Cython.</p>
<p>Using <code>quicktions</code> was,
indeed,
quicker.
It took the time down from a minute and sixteen seconds to
to a minute and fifteen seconds on my laptop.</p>
<p>Fundamentally,
the problem is that this is a quadratic algorithm.
I chose the inputs carefully:
the worst case behavior for fraction addition is on prime numbers.
But unless you can predict the inputs to an algorithm,
you cannot rely on anything but the worst-case behavior.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="decimals">
<h2>Decimals</h2>
<p>Decimal numbers are useful when managing financial transactions.
This is for the most boring reason possible:
the laws governing finance are specified in decimals.
However, all decimal point calculations in Python are governed
by hidden global state:
the <code>context</code>.
The context determines precision,
and is taken from the caricature of how action at a distance
is problematic for APIs.</p>
<p>Quoting the <a class="reference external" href="https://docs.python.org/3.8/library/decimal.html">documentation</a>
(for Python 3.8):</p>
<pre class="code literal-block">
&gt;&gt;&gt; getcontext().prec = 6
&gt;&gt;&gt; Decimal(1) / Decimal(7)
Decimal('0.142857')
&gt;&gt;&gt; getcontext().prec = 28
&gt;&gt;&gt; Decimal(1) / Decimal(7)
Decimal('0.1428571428571428571428571429')
</pre>
<p>In practice,
code might have hundreds of lines between setting the precision
and doing a calculation.
The calculation can be in another function,
or even another file.</p>
<p>The only safe way to use decimal numbers in Python is with
<code>localcontext</code>:</p>
<pre class="code literal-block">
&gt;&gt;&gt; getcontext().prec = 6
&gt;&gt;&gt; # 6853 lines elided
... with localcontext() as ctx:
...     ctx.prec = 10
...     Decimal(1) / Decimal(7)
...
Decimal('0.1428571429')
</pre>
<p>As long as you are careful to use
<cite>localcontext</cite>,
decimals work pretty well.
It is thread-safe and signal-safe.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="summary">
<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>Before you do things with numbers in your code,
stop and think.
What types should you use?
What do you want to happen?
What tolerances are important?</p>
<p>Not thinking means letting the corner cases in the code just happen.</p>
<p>(Thanks to Adi Stav, Aaron Hall, and Avy Faingezicht for their
feedback on an earlier draft.
All issues and mistakes that remain are my responsibility.)</p>
