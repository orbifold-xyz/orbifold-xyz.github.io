        <div><p>This is a joint post by <a class="reference external" href="https://enotuniq.org/">Mark Williams</a> and <a class="reference external" href="https://orbifold.xyz/">Moshe Zadka</a>.
You are probably reading it on one of our blogs --
if so,
feel free to look at the other blog.
We decided it would be fun to write a post together
and see how it turns out.
We definitely had fun writing it,
and we hope you have fun reading it.</p>
<div class="section" id="introduction">
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>A Domain Specific Language is a natural solution to many problems.
However, creating a new language from whole cloth is
both surprisingly hard and,
more importantly,
surprisingly hard to get right.</p>
<p>One needs to come up with a syntax that is easy to learn,
easy to get right,
hard to get wrong,
and has the ability to give meaningful errors when incorrect input is given.
One needs to carefully document the language,
supplying at least a comprehensive reference, a tutorial,
and a best practices guide
all with examples.</p>
<p>On top of this, one needs to write a toolchain for the language
that is as high quality as the one users are used to from
other languages.</p>
<p>All of this raises a tempting question: can we use an existing language?
In this manner, many languages have been used, or abused,
as domain specific languages --
Lisp variants (such as Scheme) were among the first to be drafted,
but were quickly followed by languages like TCL, Lua, and Ruby.</p>
<p>Python, being popular in quite a few niches,
has also been used as a choice for things related to those niches --
the configuration format for <a class="reference external" href="http://jupyter-notebook.readthedocs.io/en/latest/config.html">Jupyter</a>,
the website structure specification in <a class="reference external" href="https://trypyramid.com/">Pyramid</a>
the build directives for <a class="reference external" href="http://scons.org/">SCons</a>,
and the target specification for <a class="reference external" href="http://www.pantsbuild.org/build_files.html">Pants</a>.</p>
<p>In this post,
we will show examples of Python as a Domain Specific Language
(or DSL)
and explain how to do it well --
and how to avoid doing it badly.</p>
<p>As programmers we use a variety of languages to solve problems.
Usually these are &quot;general purpose&quot; languages, or languages whose
design allows them to solve many kinds of problems equally well.
Python certainly fits this description.  People use it to solve
problems in astronomy and biology, to answer questions about data sets
large and small, and to build games, websites, and DNS servers.</p>
<p>Python programmers know how much value there is in generality.  But
sometimes that generality makes solving a problem tedious or otherwise
difficult. Sometimes, a problem or class of problems requires so much
set up, or has so many twists and turns, that its obvious solution in
a general purpose language becomes complicated and hard to understand.</p>
<p><em>Domain specific languages</em> are languages that are tailored to solve
specific problems.  They contain special constructions, syntax, or
other affordances that organize patterns common to the problems they
solve.</p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/">Emacs</a> <a class="reference external" href="https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/elisp/Introduction.html#Introduction">Lisp</a>, or Elisp, is a Domain Specific Language focused on text
editing.  Emacs users can teach Emacs to do novel things by extending
the editor with Elisp.</p>
<p>Here's an example of an Elisp function that swaps <tt class="docutils literal">'</tt> with <tt class="docutils literal">&quot;</tt> and
vice-versa when the cursor is inside a Python string:</p>
<pre class="code literal-block">
(defun python-swap-quotes ()
  &quot;Swap single and double quotes.&quot;
  (interactive)
  (save-excursion
    (let ((state (syntax-ppss)))
      (when (eq 'string (syntax-ppss-context state))
        (let* ((left (nth 8 state))
               (right (1- (scan-sexps left 1)))
               (newquote (if (= ?' (char-after left))
                             ?\&quot; ?')))
          (dolist (loc (list left right))
            (goto-char loc)
            (delete-char 1)
            (insert-char newquote 1)))))))
</pre>
<p>This is clearly Lisp code, and parts of it, such as defining a
function with <code>defun</code> or variables with <code>let</code>, is not
specific to text editing or even Emacs.</p>
<p><code>(interactive)</code>, however, is a special extension to Elisp that
makes the function that encloses it something a user can assign to a
keyboard short cut or select from a menu inside Emacs.  Similarly,
<code>(save-excursion ...)</code> ensures that file the user is editing and
the location of the cursor is restored fter the code inside is run.
This allows the function to jump around within a file or even multiple
files without disturbing a user's place.</p>
<p>Lots of Elisp code makes use of special extensions, but Python
programmers don't complain about their absence, because they're of no
use outside Emacs.  That specialization makes Elisp a DSL.</p>
<p>The language of <a class="reference external" href="https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/#understand-how-arg-and-from-interact">Dockerfiles</a> is also a domain specific language.
Here's a <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/docker-library/hello-world/blob/7d0ee592e4ed60e2da9d59331e16ecdcadc1ed87/amd64/hello-world/Dockerfile">simple hello world Dockerfile</a>:</p>
<pre class="code literal-block">
FROM scratch
COPY hello /
ENTRYPOINT [&quot;/hello&quot;]
</pre>
<p>The word that begins each line instructs Docker to perform some action
on the arguments that follow, such as copying the file <cite>hello</cite> from
the current directory into the image's root directory.  Some of these
commands have meaning specifically to Docker, such as the <code>FROM</code>
command to underlay the image being built with a base image.</p>
<p>Note that unlike Elisp, Dockerfiles are not Turing complete, but both
are DSLs.  Domain specificity is distinct from mathematical concepts
like decidability.  It's a term we use to describe how specialized a
language is to its problem domain, not a theoretical Computer Science
term.</p>
<p>Code written in a domain specific language should be clearer and
easier to understand because the language focuses on the domain, while
the programmer focuses on the specific problem.</p>
<p>The Elisp code won't win any awards for elegance or robustness, but it
benefits from the brevity of <code>(interactive)</code> and
<code>(save-excursion ..)</code>.  Most of the function consists of the
querying and computation necessary to find and rewrite Python string
literals.  Similarly, the Dockerfile doesn't waste the reader's
attention on irrelevant details, like <em>how</em> a base image is found and
associated with the current image.  These DSLs keep their programs
focused on their problem domains, making them easier to understand and
extend.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="naive-usage-of-python-as-a-dsl">
<h2>Naive Usage of Python as a DSL</h2>
<p>Programmers describe things that hide complexity behind a dubiously
simple facade as <em>magic</em>.  For some reason,
when the idea of using Python as a DSL first comes up,
many projects choose the strategy we will call
&quot;magical execution context&quot;.
It is more common in projects written in C/C++ which embed Python,
but happens quite a bit in pure-Python projects.</p>
<p>The prototypical code that creates a magical execution context
might look something like:</p>
<pre class="code literal-block">
namespace = dict(DomainFunction1=my_domain_function1,
                 DomainFunction2=my_domain_function2)
with open('Domainspecificfile') as fp:
    source = fp.read()
exec(source, globals=namespace)
do_something_with(namespace['special_name'])
</pre>
<p>Real-life DSLs usually have more names in their magical execution contexts
(often ranging in the tens or sometimes hundreds),
and DSL runtimes often have more complicated logic around finding
the files they parse.
However, this platonic example is useful to keep in mind when
reading through the concrete examples.</p>
<p>While various other projects were automatable with Python,
SCons might be the oldest surviving project where
Python is used as a configuration language.
It also happens to be implemented <em>in</em> Python --
but aside from making the choice of Python as a DSL easier to implement,
it has no bearing on our discussion today.</p>
<p>An <code>SCons</code> file might look like this:</p>
<pre class="code literal-block">
src_files = Split(&quot;&quot;&quot;main.c
                     file1.c
                     file2.c&quot;&quot;&quot;)
Program('program', src_files)
</pre>
<p>Code can also be imported from other files:</p>
<pre class="code literal-block">
SConscript(['drivers/SConscript',
            'parser/SConscript',
            'utilities/SConscript'])
</pre>
<p>Note that it is not possible,
via this method,
to reuse any logic other than build settings across the files --
a function defined in one of them is not available elsewhere else.</p>
<p>At 12 years old, Django is another
venerable Python project, and like the similarly venerable <a class="reference external" href="http://weblog.rubyonrails.org/2005/12/13/rails-1-0-party-like-its-one-oh-oh/">Ruby on
Rails</a>, it's no stranger to magic.  Once upon a time, Django's
database interaction APIs were magical enough that they constituted a
kind of domain-specific language with a magical execution context.</p>
<p>Like modern Django, you would define your models by subclassing a
special class, but unlike modern Django, they were more than just
plain old Python classes.</p>
<p>A Django application in a module named <cite>best_sellers.py</cite> might have
had a model that looked like this:</p>
<pre class="code literal-block">
from django.core import meta

class Book(meta.Model):
      name = meta.CharField(maxlength=70)
      author = meta.CharField(maxlength=70)
      sold = meta.IntegerField()
      release_date = meta.DateTimeField(default=meta.LazyDate())

      def get_best_selling_authors(self):
          cursor = db.cursor()
          cursor.execute(&quot;&quot;&quot;
          SELECT author FROM books WHERE release_date &gt; '%s'
          GROUP BY author ORDER BY sold DESC
          &quot;&quot;&quot; % (db.quote(datetime.datetime.now() - datetime.timedelta(weeks=1)),))
          return [row[0] for row in cursor.fetchall()]

      def __repr__(self):
          return self.full_name
</pre>
<p>A user would then use it by like so:</p>
<pre class="code literal-block">
from django.models.best_sellers import books
print books.get_best_selling_authors()
</pre>
<p>Django transplated the <code>Book</code> model into its own magic
<code>models</code> module and renamed it <code>books</code>.  Note the subtle
transformation in the midst of more obvious magic: the <code>Book</code>
model was lowercased and automatically pluralized.</p>
<p>Two magic globals were injected into the model's instance methods:
<code>db</code>, the current database connection, and <code>datetime</code>, the
Python standard library module.  That's why our example module doesn't
have to import them.</p>
<p>The intent was to reduce boilerplate by exploiting Python's
dynamicism.  The result, however, diverged from Python's expected
behaviors and also invented new, idiosyncratic boilerplate; in
particular, <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/django/django/blob/674c0b353ceaace921eb3d1b5b0293b35a41ad2e/django/core/meta/__init__.py#L372-L388">the injection of special globals</a> prevented methods from
accessing variables defined in their source modules, so <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/django/django/blob/674c0b353ceaace921eb3d1b5b0293b35a41ad2e/django/models/auth.py#L151-L154">methods had
to directly import any module they used</a>, forcing programmers to
repeat themselves.</p>
<p>Django's developers came to see these features as <a class="reference external" href="https://code.djangoproject.com/wiki/RemovingTheMagic">&quot;warts&quot;</a> and
removed them before the 0.95 release.  It's safe to say that the
&quot;magic-removal&quot; process succeeded in improving Django's usability.</p>
<p>Python has well-documented built-ins.
People who read Python code are, usually, familiar with those.
Any symbol which is not a built-in or a reserved word is imported.</p>
<p>Any DSL will have its own, extra built-ins.
Ideally, those are well documented --
but even when they are, this is a source of documentation separate from
the host language.
This code can never be used by something outside the DSL.
A good example for such potential usage is for unit testing the code.
Once a DSL catches on,
it often inspires creation of vast amounts of code.
The example of Elisp is particularly telling.</p>
<p>Another problem with such code is that it's often not obvious
what the code <em>itself</em> is allowed to import or call.
Is it safe to do long-running operations?
If logging to a file, is logging properly set-up?
Will the code double log messages, or does it cache the first time it is used?
As an example,
there are a number of questions about how to share code between
<code>SCons</code> on StackOverflow,
with explanations about the trade-offs between using an
<code>SConscript</code> file or using Python modules and <code>import</code>.</p>
<p>Last, but not least, other Python code often implicitly assumes
that functions and classes are defined by modules.
This means that either it is ill-advised to write such in the DSL --
perhaps defining classes might lead to a memory leak because
the contents are used in <code>exec</code> multiple times --
or, worse, that random functionality will break.
For example, do tracebacks work correctly?
Does pickle?</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="a-new-hope">
<h2>A New Hope</h2>
<p>As seen from the examples of SCons and old, magical Django,
naively using Python as a DSL is problematic.
It gives up a lot of the benefits of using a pre-existing language,
and results in something that is in the Python uncanny valley --
just close enough to Python that the distinctions result
in a sense of horror, not cuteness.</p>
<p>One way to avoid the uncanny valley
is to step further away
and avoid confusion --
implement a little language using PyParsing
that is nothing like Python.
But valleys have two sides.
We can solve the problem by just using pure, unadulterated Python.
It turns out that removing an import statement
at the top of the file does <em>not</em> reduce
much overhead when specializing to a domain.</p>
<p>We explore, by example,
good ways to use Python as DSL.
We start by showing how even a well written module,
taking advantage of some of the power of Python,
can create a de-facto DSL.
Taking it to the next level,
frameworks (which call user code)
can also be used to build DSLs in Python.
Most powerfully, especially combined with libraries and frameworks,
Python plugin systems can be used to avoid even the need
for a user-controlled entry point,
allowing DSLs which can be invoked from an arbitrary program.</p>
<p>Python is a flexible language and
subtle use of its features can result
in a flexible DSL that still looks like Python.</p>
<p>We explore four examples of such DSLs -- NumPy, Stan, Django ORM, and Pyramid.</p>
<div class="section" id="numpy">
<h3>NumPy</h3>
<p>NumPy has the advantage of having been there since the dawn of Python,
being preceded by the Numeric library, on which it was based.
Using that long lineage, it has managed to exert some influence on adding
some things to Python core's syntax -- the Ellipsis type and the <code>&#64;</code>
operator.</p>
<p>Taking advantage of both those,
as well as combinations of things that already exist in Python,
NumPy is basically a DSL for performing multi-dimensional calculations.</p>
<p>As an example,</p>
<pre class="code literal-block">
x[4,...,5,:]
</pre>
<p>lowers the dimension of x by 2,
killing the first and next-to-last dimension. How does it work?
We can explore what happens using this proof-of-concept:</p>
<pre class="code literal-block">
class ItemGetterer(object):
    def __getitem__(self, idx):
        return idx

x = ItemGetterer()
print(x[4,...,5,:])
</pre>
<p>This prints <code>(4, Ellipsis, 5, slice(None, None, None))</code>.</p>
<p>In NumPy, the <code>__getitem__</code> method expects tuples,
and will parse them for numbers, the <code>Ellipsis</code> object
and slice objects -- and then apply them to the number.</p>
<p>In addition, overriding the methods corresponding to the
arithmetic operators, known as <em>operator overloading</em>,
allows users of NumPy to write code
that looks like the corresponding math expression.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="stan">
<h3>Stan</h3>
<p>Stan is a way to produce XML documents
using pure Python syntax.
This is often useful in web frameworks,
which need to produce HTML.</p>
<p>For illustration, here is an example stan-based program&quot;&quot;</p>
<pre class="code literal-block">
from nevow import flat, tags, stan

video = stan.Tag('video')

aDocument = tags.html[
                tags.head[
                    tags.title[&quot;Title&quot;]
                ],
                tags.body[
                    tags.h1[&quot;Heading&quot; ],
                    tags.p(class_=&quot;life&quot;)[&quot;A paragraph about life.&quot;],
                    video[&quot;Your video here!&quot;],
                ]
            ]
with open('output.html', 'w') as fp:
</pre>
<p>The <code>tags</code> module has a few popular tags.
Those are instances of the <code>stan.Tag</code> class.
If a new tag is needed, for example the <code>&lt;video&gt;</code> tag above,
one can be added locally.</p>
<p>This is completely valid Python,
without any magical execution contexts,
in a regular importable module --
which allows easy generation of HTML.</p>
<p>As an example of the advantages of making this a regular Python
execution context, we can see the benefits of dynamically generating
HTML:</p>
<pre class="code literal-block">
from nevow import flat, tags
bullets = [tags.li[&quot;bullet {}&quot;.format(i)] for i in range(10)]
aDocument = tags.html[
                tags.body[
                    tags.ul[bullets]
                ]
            ]
with open('output.html', 'w') as fp:
    fp.write(flat.flatten(aDocument))
</pre>
<p>In more realistic scenarios,
this would be based on a database call,
or a call to some microservice.
Because stan is just pure Python code,
it is easy to integrate into whatever framework expects it --
it can be returned from a function,
or set as an object attribute.</p>
<p>The line between
&quot;taking advantage Python syntax and magic method overriding&quot;
and &quot;abusing Python syntax&quot; is sometimes subtle
and always at least partially subjective.
However, Python does allow surprising flexibility
when it comes using pieces of the syntax for new purposes.</p>
<p>This gives great powers to mere library authors,
without any need esoterica
such as pushing and pulling variables into dictionaries
before or after execing code.
The <code>with</code> keyword, which we have not covered here,
also often comes in handy for building DSLs in Python
which do not need magic to work.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="django-orm">
<h3>Django ORM</h3>
<p>Operator overloading is one way Python allows programmers to imbue
existing syntax with new, domain-specific semantics.  When those
semantics describe data with a repeated structure, Python's class
system provides a natural model, and <a class="reference external" href="http://eli.thegreenplace.net/2011/08/14/python-metaclasses-by-example">*metaclasses*</a> allow you to
extend that model to suite your purpose.  This makes them a power tool
for implementing Python DSLs.</p>
<p><em>Object-relational mapping</em> (ORM) libraries often use metaclasses to
ease defining and querying database tables.  Django's <code>Model</code>
class is the canonical example.  Note that the API we're about to
describe is part of modern, post-magic-removal Django!</p>
<p>Consider the models defined in <a class="reference external" href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.11/intro/tutorial02/#creating-models">Django's tutorial</a>:</p>
<pre class="code literal-block">
from django.db import models


class Question(models.Model):
    question_text = models.CharField(max_length=200)
    pub_date = models.DateTimeField('date published')


class Choice(models.Model):
    question = models.ForeignKey(Question, on_delete=models.CASCADE)
    choice_text = models.CharField(max_length=200)
    votes = models.IntegerField(default=0)
</pre>
<p>Each class encapsulates knowledge about and actions on a database
table.  The class attributes map to columns and inter-table
relationships which power <a class="reference external" href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.11/topics/db/queries/">data manipulation</a> and from which Django
derives <a class="reference external" href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.11/intro/tutorial02/#activating-models">migrations</a>.  Django's models turn classes in a
domain-specific language for database definitions and logic.</p>
<p>Here's what the generated DML might look like:</p>
<pre class="code literal-block">
--
-- Create model Choice
--
CREATE TABLE &quot;polls_choice&quot; (
    &quot;id&quot; serial NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY,
    &quot;choice_text&quot; varchar(200) NOT NULL,
    &quot;votes&quot; integer NOT NULL
);
--
-- Create model Question
--
CREATE TABLE &quot;polls_question&quot; (
    &quot;id&quot; serial NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY,
    &quot;question_text&quot; varchar(200) NOT NULL,
    &quot;pub_date&quot; timestamp with time zone NOT NULL
);
</pre>
<p><a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/django/django/blob/a51c4de1945be2225f20fad794cfb52d8f1f9236/django/db/models/base.py#L71">A metaclass</a> plays a critical role in this DSL by instrumenting
<code>Model</code> subclasses.  It's this metaclass that <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/django/django/blob/a51c4de1945be2225f20fad794cfb52d8f1f9236/django/db/models/base.py#L352-L360">adds the objects
class attribute</a>, a <code>Manager</code> instance that mediates ORM
queries, and the class-specific <cite>DoesNotExist</cite> and
<cite>MultipleObjectsReturned</cite> <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/django/django/blob/a51c4de1945be2225f20fad794cfb52d8f1f9236/django/db/models/base.py#L116-L133">exceptions</a>.</p>
<p>Because metaclasses control class creation, they're an obvious way to
inject these kinds of class-level attributes.  For the same reason,
but less obviouly, they also provide a place to run initialization
hooks that should run only once in a program's lifetime.  Classes are
generally defined at module level.  Thus, classes are created when
modules are created.  Because of Python's module caching, this means
that metaclasses are usually run early and rarely.  Django's DSL makes
use of this assumption to <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/django/django/blob/a51c4de1945be2225f20fad794cfb52d8f1f9236/django/db/models/base.py#L315">register models with their applications</a>
upon creation.</p>
<p>Running code this soon can lead to strange issues, which make it
tricky to use metaclasses correctly.  They also rely on subclassing,
which is <a class="reference external" href="http://pyvideo.org/pycon-us-2013/the-end-of-object-inheritance-the-beginning-of.html">considered harmful</a>.  These things and their use in ORMs,
which are <a class="reference external" href="http://seldo.com/weblog/2011/06/15/orm_is_an_antipattern">also considered harmful</a>, might seem to limit their
usefulness.  However, a base class whose purpose is to inject a
metaclass avoids many of the problems associated with subclassing, as
little to no functionality will be inherited.  Django weighs the
benefits of familiar syntax over the costs of subclassing, resulting
in a data definition DSL that's ergonomic for Python programmers.</p>
<p>Despite their complexity and shortcomings, metaclasses provide a
succinct way to describe and manipulate all kinds of data, from <a class="reference external" href="http://scapy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/advanced_usage.html?highlight=metaclasses">wire
protocols</a> to <a class="reference external" href="http://pythonhosted.org/dexml/">XML documents</a>.  They can be just the trick for
data-focused DSLs.</p>

<h3>Pyramid</h3>
<p>Pyramid allows defining web application logic,
as opposed to the routing details,
anywhere.
It will match up the function to the route based on the
route name,
as defined in the configuration router.</p>
<pre class="code literal-block">
# Removed imports

## The function definition can go anywhere
&#64;view_config(route_name='home')
def my_home(context, request):
    return 'OK'

## This goes in whatever file we pass to our WSGI host
config = Configurator()
config.add_route('home', '/')
config.scan('.')
app = config.make_wsgi_app()
</pre>
<p>The builder pattern, as seen here, allows gradually creating an application.
The methods on <code>Configurator</code>,
as well as the decorators such as <code>view_config</code>,
are effectively a DSL that helps build web applications.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="plugins">
<h2>Plugins</h2>
<p>When code lives in real Python modules,
and uses real Python APIs,
it is sometimes useful for it to be executed automatically
based on context.
After all, one thing that DSL systems like SCons
give us is automatically executing the <code>SConscript</code>
when we run <code>scons</code> at the command line.</p>
<p>One tool that can be used for this is a plugin system.
While a comprehensive review of <a class="reference external" href="http://sedimental.org/plugin_systems.html">plugin systems</a>
is beyond our scope here,
we will give a few examples of using such systems
for specific domains.</p>
<p>One of the oldest plugin systems is <a class="reference external" href="https://twistedmatrix.com/documents/current/core/howto/plugin.html">twisted.plugin</a>.
While it can be used as a generic plugin system,
the main usage of it --
and a good case study of using it as a plugin system for DSLs --
is to extend the <code>twist</code> command line.
These are also known as <code>tap</code> plugins,
for historical reasons.</p>
<p>Here is a minimal example of a Twisted tap plugin:</p>
<pre class="code literal-block">
# Removed imports
&#64;implementer(IServiceMaker, IPlugin)
class SimpleServiceMaker(object):
    tapname = &quot;simple-dsl&quot;
    description = &quot;The Simplest DSLest Plugin&quot;

    class options(usage.Options):
        optParameters = [[&quot;port&quot;, &quot;p&quot;, 1235, &quot;Port number.&quot;]]

    def makeService(self, options):
        return internet.TCPServer(int(options[&quot;port&quot;]),
                                  Factory.forProtocol(Echo))

serviceMaker = SimpleServiceMaker()
</pre>
<p>In order to be a <a class="reference external" href="https://twistedmatrix.com/documents/current/core/howto/tap.html">valid plugin</a>,
this file must be placed under <code>twisted.plugins</code>.
The <code>usage.Options</code> class defines a DSL,
of sorts,
for describing command-line options.
We used only a small part of it here,
but it is both powerful and flexible.</p>
<p>Note that this is completely valid Python code --
in fact, it will be imported as a module.
This allows us to import it as well,
and to test it using unit tests.</p>
<p>In fact, because this is regular Python code,
usually <code>serviceMakers</code> are created using a helper class --
<code>twisted.application.service.ServiceMaker</code>.
The definition above, while correct,
is not idiomatic.</p>
<p>The <code>gather</code> library does not have a DSL.
It does, however,
function well as an agnostic plugin discovery mechanism.
Because of that,
it can be built into other systems --
that do provide a Pythonic DSL --
to serve as the autodiscovery mechanism.</p>
<pre class="code literal-block">
# In  a central module:
ITS_A_DSLISH_FUNCTION = gather.Collector()

## Define the DSL as
## -- functions that get two parameters
##    -- conf holds some general configuration
##    -- send_result is used to register the result
def run_the_function_named(name, conf, send_result):
    res = ITS_A_DSLISH_FUNCTION.collect()
    return res[name](conf, result)

# In a module registering a DSL function
&#64;ITS_A_DSLISH_FUNCTION.register(name='my_dslish_name')
def some_func(conf, send_result):
    with conf.temp_stuff() as some_thing:
         send_result(some_thing.get_value())
</pre>

<div class="section" id="conclusion">
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Python is a good language to use for DSLs.
So good, in fact,
that <a class="reference external" href="http://www.attrs.org/en/stable/">attrs</a>, a DSL for defining classes,
has achieved enormous popularity.
Operator overloading, decorators,
the <code>with</code> operator and generators, among other things,
combine to allow novel usage of the syntax in specific problem domains.
The existence of a big body of documentation
of the language and its best practices,
along with a thriving community of practicioners,
is also an asset.</p>
<p>In order to take advantage of all of those,
it is important to use Python as Python --
avoid magical execution contexts
and novel input search algorithms in favor
of the powerful code organization model Python already has --
modules.</p>
<p>Most people who want to use Python as a DSL
are also Python programmers.
Consider allowing your program's users
to use the same tools that have made you successful.</p>
<p>As <a class="reference external" href="https://twistedmatrix.com/users/glyph/rant/extendit.html">Glyph</a> said in a related discussion,
&quot;do you want to confuse, surprise,
and annoy people who may be familiar with Python from elsewhere?&quot;
Assuming the answer is &quot;no&quot;,
consider using real modules as your DSL mechanism.</p>
