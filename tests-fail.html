        <div><p>(Thanks to <a class="reference external" href="https://faingezicht.com/">Avy Faingezicht</a> and <a class="reference external" href="https://caremad.io/">Donald Stufft</a>
for giving me encouragement and feedback.
All mistakes that remain are mine.)</p>
<p>&quot;eyes have they, but they see not&quot; -- Psalms, 135:16</p>
<p>Eyes are expensive to maintain.
They require protection from the elements,
constant lubrication,
behavioral adaptations to protect them and more.
However,
they give us a benefit.
They allow us to see:
to detect <em>differences</em> in the environment.
Eyes register different signals when looking at an unripe fruit
and when looking at a ripe fruit.
This allows us to eat the ripe fruit,
and wait for the unripe fruit to ripen:
to behave differently,
in a way that ultimately furthers our goals
(eat yummy fruits).</p>
<p>If our eyes did not get different signals
that influenced our behavior,
they would not be cost effective.
Evolution is a harsh mistress,
and the eyes would be quickly gone if the signals from them were not valuable.</p>
<p>Writing tests is expensive.
It takes time to write them,
time to review them,
time to modify them as code evolves.
A test that never fails is like an eye that cannot see:
it always sends the same signal, &quot;eat that fruit!&quot;.
In order to be valuable,
a test must be able to fail,
and that failure must modify our behavior.</p>
<p>The only way to be sure that a test can fail
is to see it fail.
Test-driven-development does it by writing tests that fail
before modifying the code.
But even when not using TDD,
making sure that tests fail is important.
Before checking in,
<em>break your code</em>.
Best of all is to break the code in a way that would be realistic
for a maintenance programmer to do.
Then run the tests.
See them fail.
Check it in to the branch,
and watch CI fail.
Make sure that this CI failure is clearly communicated:
something big must be red,
and merging should be impossible,
or at least require using a clearly visible &quot;override switch&quot;.</p>
<p>If there is no code modification that makes the test fail,
of if such code modification is weird or unrealistic,
it is not a good test.
If a test failure does not halt the CI with a visible message,
it is not a good CI.
These are false gods,
with eyes that do not see,
and mouths that do not speak.</p>
<p>Real tests have failures.</p>
