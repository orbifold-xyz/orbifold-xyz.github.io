            <h1>Common Mistakes about Generational Garbage Collection</h1>

for their feedback on earlier drafts.
All mistakes that remain are mine.)</p>
<p>When talking about garbage collection,
the notion of &quot;generational collection&quot; comes up.
The usual motivation given for generational garbage collection
is that
&quot;most objects die young&quot;.
Therefore,
we put the objects that survive a collection cycle
(and therefore have proven some resistance)
in a separate generation
that we scan less often.</p>
<p>This is an optimization if the probability of an object that
has survived a cycle to be garbage by the time the <em>next</em>
collection cycle has come around is <em>lower</em>
than the probability of a newly allocated object to be garbage.</p>
<p>In a foundational paper
<a class="reference external" href="https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=152747">Infant mortality and generational garbage collection</a>,
<a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Baker_(computer_scientist)">Dr. Baker</a>
laid out an argument deceptive in its simplicity.</p>
<p>Dr. Baker asks the question:
&quot;Can we model a process where most objects become garbage fast,
but generational garbage collection would not improve things?&quot;.
His answer is: of course.
This is exactly the probability distribution of radioactive decay.</p>
<p>If we have a &quot;fast decaying element&quot;,
say with a half-life of one second,
than 50% of the element's atoms decay in one second.
However,
keeping the atoms that &quot;survived a generation&quot;
apart from newly created atoms is unhelpful:
all remaining atoms decay with probability of 50%.</p>
<p>We can bring the probability for &quot;young garbage&quot;
as high up as we want:
a half-life of half a second,
a quarter second,
or a microsecond.
However,
that is not going to make generational garbage collection any better
than a straightforward mark-and-sweep.</p>
<p>The Poisson distribution,
which models radioactive decay,
has the property that
<code>P(will die in one second)</code> might be high,
but
<code>P(will die in one second|survived an hour)</code>
is <em>exactly the same</em>:
the past does not give us information about the future.
This is called
the &quot;no memory property&quot;
of Poisson distribution.</p>
<p>When talking about generational garbage collection,
and especially if we are making theoretical arguments about its helpfulness,
we need to make arguments about the <em>distribution</em>,
not about the <em>averages</em>.
In other words,
we need to make an argument that <em>some kinds of objects</em>
hang around for a long time,
while others tend to die quickly.</p>
<p>One way to model it
is
&quot;objects are bimodal&quot;:
if we model objects as belonging to a mix of two Gaussian distributions,
one with a small average
and one with a big average,
then the motivation for generational collection is clear:
if we tune it right,
most objects that survive the first cycle
belong to the other distribution,
and will survive for a few more cycles.</p>
<p>To summarize:
please choose your words carefully.
&quot;Young objects are more likely to die&quot;
is an accurate motivation,
&quot;Most objects die young&quot;
is not.
This goes doubly if you <em>do</em> understand the subtlety:
do not assume the people you are talking with have
an accurate model of how garbage works.</p>
<p>As an aside,
some languages decided that generational collection is more trouble than it
is worth because the objects
that &quot;die young&quot;
go through a different allocation style.
For example,
Go has garbage collection,
but it tries to allocate objects on the stack if it can guarantee
at compile-time they do not &quot;escape&quot;.
Because of that,
the &quot;first generation&quot;
is collected at stack popping time.</p>
<p>CPython has generational garbage collection,
but it also has a &quot;zeroth generation&quot; of sorts:
when functions return,
all local variables get a &quot;decref&quot;:
a decrease in reference count.
Those for whom that results in a 0 reference counts,
which is often quite a few,
get collected immediately.</p>
