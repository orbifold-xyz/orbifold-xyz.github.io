        <div><p>Sometimes you will be working on hairy and complicated feature
in a shared repository.
Maybe it's for work.
Maybe it's an open source project.</p>
<p>As a responsible person,
you are working on a branch.
The usual way of working involves a lot of
&quot;intermediate&quot;
check-ins.
Those serve,
if nothing else,
as a form of backup.</p>
<p>If you really enjoy backing up your code,
you are probably already pushing to a remote branch
on your source control server.</p>
<p>This is a great workflow.
Responsible,
safe,
and resistant to local failures.</p>
<p>What could be better?</p>
<p>Well,
it is often the case that people hesitate to
open the pull request
(or merge request, as known in some systems)
before they are
&quot;ready&quot;.
Time to post the PR,
already!</p>
<p>If the PR is not ready,
you can mark it as not ready for merging.
Most modern systems allow an explicit flag
to make pull requests
as &quot;draft&quot;.
If nothing else,
you can use a dedicated label
like
&quot;do not merge&quot;.</p>
<p>There are a few benefits.
One is that when your Continuous Integration system runs,
this gives an obvious place to keep the results.
This avoids the need to dig in the guts of the
CI system
to find the latest tests.</p>
<p>Speaking of digging through guts,
most of these systems
allow an easy search of
&quot;all my open PRs&quot;.
This means that to find out the branches you
have been working on,
for example when getting back to the office from the weekend,
you can just open the handy-dandy
link
and immediately see the list.
(This list is also useful as
&quot;what do I need to clean up because it has become irrelevant.&quot;)</p>
<p>For some teams,
this requires a culture adjustment.
People need to allow for the code's
state in their review,
if they review at all.
Ideally,
this encourages the team to have a serious conversation
on when code is reviewed,
by whom,
and according to what criteria.</p>
<p><em>After</em>
this conversation happens,
and assuming people open PRs early in the process,
magic starts happening.
Because now,
when needing localized feedback
(for example,
&quot;am I using this function correctly&quot;)
you can link to the right place in the PR
and ask for specific feedback.</p>
<p>This feedback,
given constructively and helpfully,
allows the entire team to learn.
Working in public,
at least among your team,
is helpful to everyone.</p>
<p>So don't delay,
post the PR,
and start working better with your colleagues.</p>
