            <h1>Publishing a Book with Sphinx</h1>
Mon 08 April 2019

        <div><p>A while ago,
I decided I wanted to self-publish a book on improving
your Python skills.
It was supposed to be short,
sweet,
and fairly inexpensive.</p>
<p>The journey was a <a class="reference external" href="https://gum.co/BVOGd">success</a>,
but had some interesting twists along the way.</p>
<p>From the beginning,
I knew what technology I wanted to write the book with:
<a class="reference external" href="https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/">Sphinx</a>.
This was because I knew that I can use Sphinx to create something reasonable:
I have previously ported my
&quot;Calculus 101&quot; book
to Sphinx,
and I have written other small things in it.
Sphinx uses ReStructuredText,
which I am most familiar with.</p>
<p>I decided I wanted to publish as PDF
(for self-printers or others who find it convenient),
as browser-ready HTML directory,
and as an ePub.</p>
<p>The tox environments I <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/moshez/book-skeleton/blob/master/tox.ini">created</a> are:
<code>epub</code> builds the <em>ePub</em>,
<code>html</code> builds the browser-ready HTML,
and <code>pdf</code> builds the PDF.</p>
<p>Initially,
the <code>epub</code> environment created a &quot;singlehtml&quot;,
and I used <a class="reference external" href="https://calibre-ebook.com/">Calibre</a> command-line utility to transform it into an ePub.
This made for a <em>prettier</em> ePub than the one sphinx creates:
it had a much nicer cover,
which is what most book reading applications use as an icon.
However, that rendered poorly on Books.app (AKA iBooks).</p>
<p>One of the projects I still plan to tackle is how to improve the look
of the rendered ePub,
and add a custom cover image.</p>
<p>Finally,
a <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/moshez/book-skeleton/blob/master/generate-artifact">script</a>
runs all the relevant tox environments,
and then packs everything into a zip file.
This is the zip file I upload to <a class="reference external" href="https://gumroad.com/">Gumroad</a>,
so that people can buy it.</p>
<p>I have tried to use other sellers,
but Gumroad was the one with the easiest store creation.
In order to test my store,
even before the book was ready,
I created a simple &quot;Python cheat-sheet&quot; poster,
and put it on my store.</p>
<p>I then asked friends to buy it,
as well as trying to do it myself.
After it all worked,
I refunded all the test-run purchases, of course!</p>
<p>Refunding on Gumroad is a pleasant process,
which means that if people buy the book,
and are unhappy with it,
I am happy to refund their money.</p>
<p>(Thanks to Glyph Lefkowitz for his feedback on an earlier draft.
All mistakes that remain are my responsibility.)</p>
