        <div><p>A couple of months ago,
a successful attack against the Node ecosystem
resulted in stealing an undisclosed amount
of bitcoins from
<a class="reference external" href="https://blog.bitpay.com/npm-package-vulnerability-copay/">CoPay wallets</a>.</p>
<p>The technical flow of the attack is well-summarized
by the <a class="reference external" href="https://blog.npmjs.org/post/180565383195/details-about-the-event-stream-incident">NPM blog post</a>.
Quick summary:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><cite>nodemon</cite>, a popular way to run Node applications, depends on <cite>event-stream</cite>.</li>
<li>The <cite>event-stream</cite> maintainer has not had time to maintain it.</li>
<li><cite>right9control</cite> asked <cite>event-stream</cite> maintainer for commit privileges to help maintain it.</li>
<li><cite>right9control</cite> added a dependency on a new library, <cite>flatmap-stream</cite>.</li>
<li><cite>flatmap-stream</cite> contained malicious code to steal wallets.</li>
</ol>
<div class="section" id="obfuscation">
<h2>Obfuscation</h2>
<p>A <em>number</em> of methods were done to disguise the attack.</p>
<p>The dependency was an added in a minor version,
and a new version was immediately released.
This meant that most projects,
which pin to minor,
would get the updates,
while it stayed invisible on the main GitHub landing page,
or the main npm landing page.</p>
<p>The malicious code was only in the minified version of the library
that was uploaded to <code>npm.org</code>.
The non-minified source code on both GitHub and <code>npm.org</code>,
as well as the minified code on GitHub,
did not contain the malicious code.</p>
<p>The malicious code was encrypted with a key that used the
description of <em>other</em> packages in the dependency tree.
That made it impossible to understand the attack
without guessing which package decrypts it.</p>
<p>The combination of all those methods meant that the
problem remained undetected for <em>two months</em>.
It was only luck that detected it:
the decryption code was using a <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/remy/nodemon/issues/1442">deprecated function</a>,
and investigating the deprecation message led to the issue
being figured out.</p>
<p>This bears thinking about:
if the code had been written <em>slightly better</em>,
the problem would have <em>still</em> be happening now,
and nobody would be the wiser.
We should not discount the possibility that <em>currently</em>,
someone who followed the same playbook
but managed to use AES correctly is still attacking
some package,
and we have no idea.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="solutions-and-non-solutions">
<h2>Solutions and Non-Solutions</h2>
<p>I want to discuss some non-solutions in trying to understand
how this problem came about.</p>
<div class="section" id="better-vetting-of-maintainers">
<h3>Better Vetting of Maintainers</h3>
<p>It is true,
the person who made this commit had an
obviously-auto-generated username
(<code>&lt;word&gt;-&lt;digit&gt;-&lt;word&gt;</code>)
and made few contributions before getting control.
But short of meeting people in person,
I do not think this would work.</p>
<p><em>Attackers adapt</em>.
Ask for better usernames,
they will generate
&quot;&lt;firstname&gt;-&lt;lastname&gt;&quot;
names.
Are you going to disallow my GitHub username,
<code>moshez</code>?
Ask for more contributions,
you will get some trivial-code-that's-uploaded-to-npm,
autogenerated a bit to disguise it.
Ask for longer commit history,
they'll send fixes to trivial issues.</p>
<p>Remember that this is a <em>distributed</em> problem,
with each lead maintainer having to come up with a vetting procedure.
Otherwise,
you get usernames through the vetting process,
and then you use those to spam maintainers,
who now are <em>sure</em> they can trust those &quot;vetted&quot;.</p>
<p>In short,
this is one of the classical defenses
that fails to take into considerations that attackers adapt.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="any-solution-that-depends-on-javascript-specific-things">
<h3>Any Solution That Depends on JavaScript-specific Things</h3>
<p>This attack could easily have been executed against
PyPI
or
RubyGems.
Any solution that relies on JavaScript's ability to
have a <a class="reference external" href="https://medium.com/agoric/pola-would-have-prevented-the-event-stream-incident-45653ecbda99">least-access</a>-based solution only helps
make sure that these attacks go elsewhere.</p>
<p>It's not <em>bad</em> to do it.
It just does not solve the root cause.</p>
<p>This also means that &quot;stop relying on minified code&quot;
is a non-solution in the world where we encourage
Python engineers
to
<a class="reference external" href="https://hynek.me/articles/sharing-your-labor-of-love-pypi-quick-and-dirty/">upload wheels</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="any-solution-that-depends-on-audit-code">
<h3>Any Solution That Depends on &quot;Audit Code&quot;</h3>
<p>A typical medium-sized JavaScript client app depends on
some 2000 packages.
Auditing each one,
on each update,
would make using third-packages untenable.
This means that start-ups playing fast and loose with
these rules would gain an advantage over those who do not.
Few companies can afford that pay that much for security.</p>
<p>Hell,
we <a class="reference external" href="https://hackernoon.com/im-harvesting-credit-card-numbers-and-passwords-from-your-site-here-s-how-9a8cb347c5b5">knew this was a possibility</a>
a few months before the <em>attack was initiated</em>
and still nobody did code auditing.
Starting now would mostly mean availability bias,
which means it would be over as soon as another
couple of months go by without a documented attack.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="partial-solution-open-source-sustainability">
<h3>Partial Solution -- Open Source Sustainability</h3>
<p>If we <a class="reference external" href="https://www.quansight.com/open-source-partnerships">could</a> <a class="reference external" href="https://tidelift.com/">just</a> <a class="reference external" href="https://twitter.com/jacobian/status/1086389182157733889">pay</a> maintainers,
they would be slightly more comfortable maintaining
packages and less desperate for help.
This means that it would become <em>inherently</em>
slightly harder to quickly become a new maintainer.</p>
<p>However,
it is worthwhile to consider that this still would not
solve the subtler &quot;adding a new dependency&quot;
attack described earlier:
just making a &quot;good&quot; library and getting other libraries
to depend on it.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="summary">
<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>I do not know how to prevent the &quot;next&quot; attack.
<a class="reference external" href="https://www.hillelwayne.com/post/stamping-on-eventstream/">Hillel</a> makes the point that a lot of &quot;root causes&quot;
will only prevent almost-exact repeats,
while failing to address trivial variations.
Remember that <em>one trivial variation</em>,
avoiding deprecation warnings,
would have made this attack much more successful.</p>
<p>I am concerned that,
as an industry,
we are not discussing this attack a mere
<em>two months</em>
after discovery and mitigation.
We are vulnerable.
We will be attacked again.
We need to be prepared.</p>
