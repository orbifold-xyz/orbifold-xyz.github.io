        <div><p>&quot;It's ok to mess up your own room.&quot;</p>
<p>Sometime there is a problem where the design is obvious --
at least to you.
Maybe it's simple.
Maybe you've solved one like that many times.
In those cases,
just go ahead --
use Test-Driven-Development, lint your code as you're writing,
and push a branch full of beautiful code, ready to be merged.</p>
<p>This is the exception, rather than the rule, though.
In real life, half of the time, we have no idea what we are doing.
Is a recursive or iterative solution better?
How exactly does this SaaS work?
What does Product Management <em>actually</em> want?
What is, exactly, the answer to life, the universe and everything?</p>
<p>A lot of the time,
solving a problem becomes with exploratory programming.
Writing little snippets, testing them out,
writing more snippets,
throwing some away when they seem to be going down a bad path,
saving some from earlier now that we understand the structure better.
Poking and prodding at the problem,
until the problem's boundaries become clearer.</p>
<p>This is,
after all,
why dyamic languages became popular --
Python became popular in web development and scientific computing
precisely because in both places,
&quot;exploratory programming&quot; is important.</p>
<p>In those cases, every single rule about &quot;proper software development&quot;
goes straight out the window.
Massive functions are fine, when you don't know how to break them.
Code with one letter variables is fine, when you are likely to throw it away.
Code with bad formatting is fine, when you are likely to refactor it.
Code with no tests is fine, if it's doing the wrong thing anyway.
Code with big commented out sections is fine, if those are likely
to prove useful in an hour.</p>
<p>In short,
every single rule of &quot;proper software development&quot;
goes out the window when we are exploring a problem,
testing its boundaries.
All but one -- work on a branch, and keep your work backed up.
Luckily, all modern version control systems have good branch isolation
and easy branch pushing,
so there is no problem.
No problem, except the social one --
people are embarrassed at writing &quot;bad code&quot;.
Please don't be.
Everyone does it.
Just <em>don't merge</em> it into the production code --
that will legitimately annoy other people.</p>
<p>But as long as the mess is in your own room,
don't worry about cleaning it up.</p>
