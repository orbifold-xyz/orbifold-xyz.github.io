        <div><p>John H. Conway passed away ten days ago,
and I think it's only now I can write a proper eulogy.</p>
<p>I was first introduced to his work,
if not his name,
when I was at the end of elementary school.
I am sure everyone has heard about the Game of Life,
but did you know it had a 1D version?
The 1D version is significantly simpler,
but has the advantage that on a grid paper,
you can just play with yourself manually by putting a generation on each line.</p>
<p>This was 12 year old me's &quot;fidget spinner&quot;,
how I kept myself calm in classes.
Starting with an initial configuration and letting it evolve.</p>
<p>Later on,
when I went to college,
I got to borrow his amazing book,
&quot;On Numbers and Games&quot;.
Now,
I am definitely the sort of person who reads math books for fun,
but most of them are not fun.
They are dry,
poorly written,
and make leaps all the time.
&quot;ONAG&quot; was the exact opposite.
It's a short, delightful book,
that tries to get across the thinking,
the intuition, the methods,
and, yes, the joy.</p>
<p>Fast forward a decade or two,
and again I found myself enamored with another one of his inventions:
the Look-and-Say sequence.
My old interview coding question was getting too popular on the interview-question-sites,
and I was getting worried.
Writing code for the look-and-say sequence is reasonably straightforward,
but does require basic skills:
looping while keeping a bunch of state variables.</p>
<p>Then I read about his work on the look-and-say sequence,
and was utterly amazed and delighted by it.
Atoms and decay and asymptotic growth!</p>
<p>Throughtout his career,
I think what made his things special is that he embodies the truest
mathematician spirit,
which is also the truest geek spirit:
starting out with something simple,
and then nerding out about it until you have built a whole universe.</p>
<p>Whether it is a place where guns shoot spaceships at 3/8 the speed of light,
an algebraic field so vast it includes all other ordered fields and also all infinities,
or a concept of numbers atomically decaying,
he was a master at whipping out mathematicially consistent fictional worlds.</p>
<p>Goodbye John H. Conway,
you were taken from us too soon.</p>
