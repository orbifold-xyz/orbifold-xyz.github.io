        <div><p><strong>Announcment</strong>: My book, <a class="reference external" href="https://gumroad.com/l/BVOGd">from python import better</a>, has been published.
This post is based on one of the chapters from it.</p>
<p>When Python started out,
one of the oft-touted benefits was &quot;batteries included!&quot;.
Gone were the days of searching for which XML parsing library was the best --
just use the one built-in to the standard library.
However,
the standard library can only hold so much special purpose stuff.
Few now remember,
but it used to have <a class="reference external" href="https://docs.python.org/2/library/al.html">SGI Audio</a> specific functionality.</p>
<p>These days,
one of the biggest benefits of Python is the extensive third-party
repository of stuff.
This is the Python Package Index (PyPI),
formerly known as the &quot;Cheese Shop&quot; after an obscure Monty Python skit.
Of course,
what else would be available from the Cheese shop than <em>wheels</em> of cheese?
But a second pun was hiding behind the term &quot;wheels&quot;:
those are the things that need no reinvention!</p>
<p>The new <a class="reference external" href="https://mail.python.org/pipermail/distutils-sig/2018-April/032195.html">PyPI warehouse launched</a>,
with new code hosting unbelievable amounts of content:
around 140,000 packages at times of this post
(unless I take too long in publishing it,
and then who knows how big PyPI will be!)</p>
<p>Nobody can sift through 140K package descriptions,
of course.
A short-lived attempt to have &quot;Stars&quot; fell victim to allegations
of ballot stuffing and moderation,
and was quickly removed.
Searching on key words would be useful,
but searching without sorting rarely is --
and what would you sort <em>on</em>?</p>
<p>PyPI is not the place to find which libraries are useful.
It is the place to find objective truths:
which version is the latest,
when was it released,
what is a project's homepage,
etc.
Recommendations are best found elsewhere.</p>
<p>The first place I like to start is with the <a class="reference external" href="https://awesome-python.com">Awesome Python</a> list.
However,
it is important to note that its contribution guidelines are just
&quot;submit a link&quot;
and there is <em>no</em> official way to remove a library from the list.
Thus,
the &quot;awesome&quot; in the name means
&quot;someone once thought it was awesome,
and cared enough to add it&quot;.
The list should be treated as mild suggestions.
Before using a library,
check release history,
GitHub health,
code quality and other metrics you might care about.</p>
<p>Another useful resource is <a class="reference external" href="http://planetpython.org/">Planet Python</a>.
It is a feed aggregator of various blogs.
Many of the blog posts will feature either
a recommendation of a particular library,
a release announcement,
or just discussion which involves using a third-party library.
Along side the written word is the live performance --
<a class="reference external" href="http://pyvideo.org/">PyVideo</a> links to more Python talks than you can shake a stick at,
aggregating talks from conferences around the world:
again,
many of the talks will feature discussion of a particular third-party library.</p>
<p>Last,
but not least,
the live, interactive, version of PyVideo:
Python meetups and conferences.
Those are where I discovered some of my favorite libraries.</p>
