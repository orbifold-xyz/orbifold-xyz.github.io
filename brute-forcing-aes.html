        <div><p>Thanks to Paul Kehrer for reviewing!
Any mistakes or oversights that are left are my responsibility.</p>
<p>AES's maximum key size is 256 bits
(there are also 128 and 192 bit versions available).
Is that enough?
Well, if there is a <em>cryptographic flaw</em> in AES
(i.e.,
a way to recover some bits of the key by some manipulation
that takes less than 2**256 operations),
then it depends on how big the flaw is.
All algorithms come with the probablistic &quot;flaw&quot; that,
on average,
only 50% of the keys need to be tested --
since the right key is just as easily in the first half
as the second half.
This means, on average, just 2**255 operations are needed to
check &quot;all&quot; keys.</p>
<p>If there is an <em>implementation flaw</em> in your AES
implementation,
then it depends on the flaw --
most implementation flaws are &quot;game over&quot;.
For example, if the radio leakage from the CPU is enough to detect key bits,
the entire key can be recovered --
but that would be true
(with only minor additional hardship)
if the key was 4K bit long.
Another example is a related subkey attack,
where many messages are encrypted with keys that have a certain relationship
to each other
(e.g., sharing a prefix).
This implementation flaw (in a different encryption algorithm)
defeated the WEP WiFi standard.</p>
<p>What if there is none?
What if actually recovering a key requires checking all possibilities?
Can someone do it,
if they have a &quot;really big&quot; computer?
Or a $10B data-center?</p>
<p>How much is 256-bit security really worth?</p>
<p>Let's see!</p>
<p>We'll be doing a lot of unit conversions,
so we bring in the <code>pint</code> library,
and create a new unit registry.</p>
<pre class="code literal-block">
import pint
REGISTRY = pint.UnitRegistry()
</pre>
<p>Assume we have a <em>really</em> fast computer.
How fast?
As fast as theoretically possible,
or so.
The time it takes a photon to cross the nucleus of the hydrogen atom
(a single proton)
is called a &quot;jiffy&quot;.
(If someone tells you they'll be back in a jiffy,
they're probably lying --
unless they're really fast,
and going a very short distance!)</p>
<pre class="code literal-block">
REGISTRY.define('jiffy = 5.4*10**-44 seconds')
</pre>
<p>Some secrets are temporary.
Your birthday surprise party is no longer a secret after your friends yell
&quot;surprise!&quot;.
Some secrets are long-lived.
The British kept the secret of the broken Enigma until none were in use --
long after WWII was done.</p>
<p>Even the Long Now Foundation,
though,
does not have concrete plans post-dating the death of our sun.
No worries,
unless the Twisted gets <a class="reference internal" href="#more-efficient">more efficient</a>,
the cursed orb has got a few years on it.</p>
<pre class="code literal-block" id="more-efficient">
sun_life = 10**10 * REGISTRY.years
</pre>
<p>With our super-fast computer,
how many ticks do we get until the light of the sun shines no longer...</p>
<pre class="code literal-block">
ticks = sun_life.to('jiffy').magnitude
</pre>
<p>...and how many do we need to brute-force AES?</p>
<pre class="code literal-block">
brute_force_aes = 2**256
</pre>
<p>Luckily,
brute-force parallelises really well:
just have each computer check a different part of the key-space.
We have fast computer technology,
and quite a while,
so how many do we need?</p>
<pre class="code literal-block">
parallel = brute_force_aes / ticks
</pre>
<p>No worries!
Let's just take over the US,
and use its entire Federal budget to finance our computers.</p>
<pre class="code literal-block">
US_budget = 4 * 10**12
</pre>
<p>Assume our technology is cheap --
maintaining each computer,
for the entire lifetime of the sun,
costs a mere $1.</p>
<p>Do we have enough money?</p>
<pre class="code literal-block">
parallel/US_budget
</pre>
<pre class="code literal-block">
4953.566155198452
</pre>
<p>Oh,
we are only off by a factor of about 5000.
We just need the budget of 5000 more countries,
about as wealthy as the US,
in order to fund our brute-force project.</p>
<p>Again,
to be clear,
none of this is a <em>cryptographic analysis</em> of AES --
but AES is the target of much analysis,
and thus far,
no theoretical flaw has been found that gives more than a bit or two.
Assuming AES is secure,
and assuming the implementation has no flaws,
brute-forcing AES is impossible --
even with alien technology,
plenty of time
and access to quite a bit of the world's wealth.</p>
