        <div><p>&quot;It is a truth universally acknowledged,
that a shared state in possession of mutability,
must be in want of a bug.&quot;
--
with apologies to Jane Austen</p>
<p>As Ms. Austen,
and
<a class="reference external" href="https://henrikeichenhardt.blogspot.com/2013/06/why-shared-mutable-state-is-root-of-all.html">Henrik Eichenhardt</a>,
taught us,
shared mutable state is
the root of all evil.</p>
<p>Yet,
the official documentation of <a class="reference external" href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functools.html#functools.lru_cache">functools</a>
tells us to write code like:</p>
<pre class="code literal-block">
&#64;lru_cache(maxsize=32)
def get_pep(num):
    'Retrieve text of a Python Enhancement Proposal'
    resource = 'http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-%04d/' % num
    try:
        with urllib.request.urlopen(resource) as s:
            return s.read()
    except urllib.error.HTTPError:
        return 'Not Found'
</pre>
<p>(This code is copied from the official documentation,
verbatim.)</p>
<p>The decorator,
<code>&#64;lru_cache(maxsize=32)</code>,
is now...
module-global mutable state.
It doesn't get any more <em>shared</em>,
in Python,
than module-global:
every import of the module will share the object!</p>
<p>We try and pretend like there is no
&quot;semantic&quot;
difference:
the cache is
&quot;merely&quot;
an optimization.
However,
very quickly things start falling apart:
after all,
why would the documentation even tell us how to get back the original function
(answer: <code>.__wrapped__</code>)
if the cache is so benign?</p>
<p>No,
decorating the function with <code>lru_cache</code>
is anything but benign!
For one,
because it is shared-thread mutable state,
we have introduced some thread locking,
with all the resulting complexity,
and occasional surprising performance issues.</p>
<p>Another example of non-benign-ness is that,
in the <code>get_pep</code> example,
sometimes a transient error,
such as a <code>504</code>,
will linger on,
making all subsequent requests &quot;fail&quot;,
until a cache eviction
(because an unrelated code path went through several PEPs)
causes a retry.
These are exactly the kind of bugs which lead to warnings
against shared mutable state!</p>
<p>If we want to cache,
let us own it explicitly in the using code,
and not have a global implementation dictate it.
Fortunately,
there is a way to
<em>properly</em>
use the LRU cache.</p>
<p>First,
remove the decorator from the implementation:</p>
<pre class="code literal-block">
def get_pep(num):
    'Retrieve text of a Python Enhancement Proposal'
    # Same code as an in official example
</pre>
<p>Then, in the <em>using code</em>,
build a cache:</p>
<pre class="code literal-block">
def analyze_peps():
    cached_get_pep = lru_cache(maxsize=32)(get_pep)
    all_peps, pep_by_type = analyze_index(cached_get_pep(0))
    words1 = get_words_in_peps(cached_get_pep, all_peps)
    words2 = get_words_in_informational(cached_get_pep,
                                        pep_by_type[&quot;Informational&quot;])
    do_something(words1, words2)
</pre>
<p>Notice that in this example,
the lifetime of the cache is relatively clear:
we create it in the beginning of the function,
passed it to called functions,
and then it goes out of scope and is deleted.
(Barring one of those functions sneakily keeping a reference,
which would be a bad implementation,
and visible when reviewing it.)</p>
<p>This means we do not have to worry about cached failures if the function
is retried.
If we retry <code>analyze_peps</code>,
we know that it will retry retrieving any PEPs,
even if those failed before.</p>
<p>If we wanted the cache to persist between invocations of the function,
the right solution would be to move it one level up:</p>
<pre class="code literal-block">
def analyze_peps(cached_get_peps):
    # ...
</pre>
<p>Then it is the caller's responsibility to maintain the cache:
once again,
we avoid shared mutable state by making the state management
be explicit.</p>
<p>In this example,
based on the official <cite>lru_cache</cite> documentation,
we used a network-based function to show some of the issues with a global cache.
Often,
<cite>lru_cache</cite> is used for performance reasons.
However,
even there,
it is easy to create issues:
for example,
one function using non-common inputs to the LRU-cached functions
can cause massive cache evictions,
with surprising performance impacts!</p>
<p>The <code>lru_cache</code> implementation is great:
but using it as a decorator means making the cache global,
with all the bad effects.
Using it locally is a good use of a great implementation.</p>
<p>(Thanks to
Adi Stav,
Steve Holden,
and James Abel
for their feedback
on early drafts.
Any issues that remain
are my responsibility.)</p>
